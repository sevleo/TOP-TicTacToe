### About the project

This project was created for the <span><a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe">Project: Tic Tac Toe assignment</a></span> of The Odin Project Curriculum. Here I'm using modules to isolate areas of code, factory functions to create and maintain player objects. The project showcases implementation of the minimax algorithm to create an unbeatable AI.
