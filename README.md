# Tic-Tac-Toe

This project was created as a project in the [JavaScript Path of The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe). Here I'm using modules to isolate areas of code, factory functions to create and maintain player objects. The project showcases implementation of the minimax algorithm to create an unbeatable AI.
